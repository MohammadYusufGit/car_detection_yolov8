### Car Detection YOLOv8
#### Overview
This project demonstrates how to use YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect objects in videos. Specifically, it processes video frames to identify cars, draw bounding boxes, and save the annotated video.
#### Features
Detect objects in video frames using YOLOv8.
Focuses on detecting the "car" class (COCO class ID: 2).
Saves the processed video with bounding boxes and labels.
#### Requirements
Python 3.8+,
YOLOv8 (via ultralytics),
OpenCV
